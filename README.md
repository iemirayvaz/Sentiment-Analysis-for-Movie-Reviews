# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Movie-Reviews
this is a class project for BLM2642/Yıldız Technical University. I implemented three optimization techniques(Gradient Descent, SGD, Adam). Then used them for sentiment analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. Results are visualized using matplotlib and scikit-learn.
